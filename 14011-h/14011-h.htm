<b>SION HOUSE.</b>
</div>



<p>
Taylor, the water poet, or Samuel Ireland, the picturesque Thames
tourist, could not, in all their enthusiasm of jingling rhymes and
aquatint plates, have exceeded our admiration of Sion House. Its
whitened towers and battlemented roof are known to all the swan-hopping
and steam navigators of our day, and none who have floated
</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
           <p>  To where the silver Thames first rural grows,&mdash;</p>
</div></div>



<p>
can be strangers to the magnificence of the river-front.
</p>

<p>
Sion House stands in the parish of Isleworth, on the Middlesex bank
of the Thames, and opposite Richmond gardens. It is called Sion
from a nunnery of Bridgetines of the same name, originally founded at
Twickenham, by Henry V. in 1414, and removed to this spot in 1432.
This conventual association consisted of sixty nuns, the abbess,
thirteen priests, four deacons, and eight lay brethren; the whole thus
corresponding, in point of number, with the Apostles and seventy-two
disciples of Christ. But the inmates were neither sinless nor spotless;
many irregularities existed in the foundation, and consequently, Sion
was among the first of the larger monastic institutions suppressed by
Henry VIII. The estimated yearly value was 1,944<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>. 8-1/2<i>d</i>.,
now worth 38,891<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>.
</p>

<p>
After the dissolution of this convent, in 1532, it continued in the
crown during the remainder of Henry's reign; and the King confined here
his unfortunate Queen, Catherine Howard, from November 14, 1541, to
February 10, 1542, being three days before her execution. Edward VI.
granted it to his uncle, the Duke of Somerset, who, in 1547, began to
build this spacious structure, and finished the shell of it nearly as it
now remains. The house is a majestic edifice of white stone, built in a
quadrangular form, with a flat and embattled roof, with a square turret
at each of the outward angles. In the centre is an enclosed area, now
laid out as a flower garden. The gardens were originally enclosed by
high walls before the east and west fronts, so as to exclude all
prospect; but the Protector,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>
to remedy this inconvenience, built a high
terrace in the angle between the walls of the two gardens. After his
execution, in 1552, Sion was forfeited; and the house, which was given
to John, Duke of Northumberland, then became the residence of his son,
Lord Guildford Dudley, and of his daughter-in-law, the unfortunate Lady
Jane Grey, who resided at this place when the Duke of Northumberland and
Suffolk, and her husband, came to prevail upon her to accept the fatal
present of the crown. The duke being beheaded in 1553, Sion House
reverted to the crown. Queen Mary restored it to the Bridgetines, who
possessed it till they were finally expelled by Elizabeth. In 1604, Sion
House was granted to Henry Percy, ninth Earl of Northumberland, in
consideration of his eminent services. His son, Algernon, employed Inigo
Jones to new face the inner court, and to finish the great hall in the
manner in which it now appears. In 1682, Charles, Duke of Somerset, by
his marriage with the only child of Joceline, Earl of Northumberland,
became possessed of Sion House: he lent the mansion to the Princess
Anne, who resided here during the misunderstanding between her and Queen
Mary. Upon the duke's death, in 1748, his son, Algernon, gave Sion House
to Sir Hugh and Lady Elizabeth Smithson, his son-in-law and daughter,
afterwards Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, who made many fine
improvements here, under the direction of Robert Adam, Esq. The late
duke (who distinguished himself at the battle of Bunker's Hill) passed
the principal part of his time at this seat; and here, also, he died,
in the year 1815. The present duke has expended immense sums in the
improvement of the mansion, grounds, and gardens.
</p>

<p>
The entrance is from the great road through a fine gateway, having on
each side an open colonnade, and on the top a lion passant, the crest
of the noble house of Northumberland. A flight of steps leads into the
great hall, sixty-six feet by thirty-one feet, and thirty-four in
height, paved with white and black marble, and ornamented with colossal
statues, and an extremely fine bronze cast of the Dying Gladiator, cast
at Rome, by Valadier. A flight of veined marble steps leads to the
vestibule, with a floor of scagliola, and twelve large Ionic columns
and sixteen pilasters of <i>verde antique</i>. This leads to the dining
room, ornamented with marble statues and paintings in <i>chiaro
oscuro</i>, after the antique, with, at each end, a circular recess,
separated by Corinthian columns, fluted, and a ceiling in stucco, gilt.
The drawing room has a rich carved ceiling; and the sides are hung with
three-coloured silk damask, the finest of the kind ever executed in
England. The antique mosaic tables, and the chimney-piece of this
apartment are very splendid, as are also the glasses, which are 108
inches by 65. The great gallery, serving for the library and museum, is
133-½ feet by 14, is in stucco, after the finest remains of antiquity,
and is remarkable as the first specimen of stucco work finished in
England. A series of medallion-paintings here represents the portraits
of all the earls of Northumberland, in succession, and other principal
persons of the houses of Percy and Seymour. At each end is a little
pavilion, finished in exquisite taste; as is also a beautiful closet
in one of the square turrets rising above the roof, which commands an
enchanting prospect.
</p>

<p>
From the east end of the gallery is a suite of private apartments
leading back to the great hall, and hung with valuable paintings,
among which are the following portraits: Henry Percy, ninth Earl of
Northumberland, who was implicated in the Gunpowder Plot, and imprisoned
in the Tower; he died November 5, 1632, the anniversary of the day so
fatal to his happiness. Lucy, Countess of Carlisle, his daughter, one of
the most admired beauties of her time; she also died November 5, 1660.
Algernon Percy, tenth Earl of Northumberland. Charles I. and one of his
sons, by Sir P. Lely. Charles I. by Vandyke. Queen Henrietta Maria,
Vandyke. The Duke of Gloucester, son of Charles I. The Princess
Elizabeth, daughter of Charles I.; this is believed to be the only
picture extant of this lady. The above portraits of the Stuart family
are placed in the apartments in which Charles had so many tender
interviews with his children, after the latter were committed to the
charge of Earl Algernon Percy, and removed to Sion House, in August,
1646. The earl treated them with parental attention, and obtained a
grant of Parliament for the king to be allowed to see them; and in
consequence of this indulgence, the latter, who was then under restraint
at Hampton Court, often dined with his family at Sion House.
</p>

<p>
Two of the principal fronts of Sion House command very beautiful
scenery; for even the Thames itself appears to belong to the gardens,
which are separated into two parts by a serpentine river that
communicates with the Thames.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span>
</p>

<p>
The gardens were principally laid out by Brown: they have, however,
been lately improved and re-arranged; and the kitchen-garden is almost
unequalled by any thing in the kingdom. Here is a range of hothouses
upwards of 400 feet in length, constructed of metal, even to the
wall-plates, the doors, and framing of the sashes; the whole being
glazed with plate-glass. It is impossible for us to describe the extent
and completeness of these improvements, connected with which, Mr. Loudon
observes&mdash;"nothing can be more gratifying than to see a nobleman
employing a part of his income in so judicious and spirited a
manner."<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>

The Londiners pronounce woe to him, that buyes a horse in Smith-field,
that takes a Seruant in Paul's Church, that marries a Wife out of
Westminster. Londiners, and all within the sound of Bow-Bell, are in
reproch called Cocknies, and eaters of buttered tostes. The Kentish
men of old were said to haue tayles, because trafficking in the Low
Countries, they neuer paid full payments of what they did owe, but still
left some part vnpaid. Essex men are called calues, (because they abound
there,) Lankashire eggepies, and to be wonne by an Apple with a red
side. Norfolke wyles (for crafty litigiousness:) Essex stiles, (so many
as make walking tedious,) Kentish miles (of the length.)

<h3>
	ORIGIN OF THE WORD SMECTYMNUUS.
</h3>

<center>
(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</center>


<p>
This was a cant term that made some figure in the time of the Civil War,
and during the Interregnum. It was formed of the initial letters of the
names of five eminent Presbyterian ministers of that time, viz. Stephen
Marshall, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, Matthew Newcomen, and William
Spenstow; who, together, wrote a book against Episcopacy, in the year
1641, whence they and their retainers were called Smectymnuans. They
wore handkerchiefs about their necks for a note of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>
distinction (as the
officers of the parliament-army then did) which afterwards degenerated
into cravats.

THE SELECTOR;<br /> AND<br /> LITERARY NOTICES OF<br /><i>NEW WORKS</i>.

<h3>
VIDOCQ. (<i>Concluded</i>.)
</h3>


<p>
We have a vulgar book called <i>Frauds of London laid open</i>, and
Vidocq's fourth volume will serve for Paris, since he defines the
nomenclature&mdash;nay the very craft of thieves with great minuteness:
thus&mdash;
</p>


<center>
<i>The Chevaliers Grimpants</i>.
</center>


<p>
"The Chevaliers Grimpants, called also <i>voleurs au bonjour</i>, <i>donneurs
de bonjours</i>, <i>bonjouriers</i>, are those who introduce themselves into a
house and carry off in an instant the first movable commodity that falls
in their way. The first <i>bonjouriers</i> were I am assured, servants
out of place. They were at first few in number, but, soon acquiring
pupils, their industry increased so rapidly, that from 1800 to 1812,
there was scarcely a day that robberies were not committed in Paris of
from a dozen to fifteen baskets of plate.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Almanach du commerce, l'Almanach royal</i>, and that with
twenty-five thousand addresses in it, are, for bonjouriers, the most
interesting works that can be published. Every morning, before they go
out, they consult them; and when they propose visiting any particular
house, it is very seldom that they are not acquainted with the names of
at least two persons in it; and that they may effect an entrance, they
inquire for one when they see the porter, and endeavour to rob the other.
</p>

<p>
"A <i>bonjourier</i> has always a gentlemanly appearance, and his shoes
always well made and thin. He gives the preference to kid before any
other leather, and takes care to bruise and break the sole that it may
not creak or make any noise; sometimes the sole is made of felt; at
other times, and especially in winter, the kid slipper, or dogskin shoe,
is replaced by list shoes, with which they can walk, go up stairs, or
descend a staircase, without any noise. The theft <i>au bonjour</i>, is
effected without violence, without skeleton keys, without burglariously
entering. If a thief sees a key in a door of a room, he first knocks
very gently, then a little harder, then very loudly; if no person
answers, he turns the handle, and thus enters the antechamber.
He then advances to the eating-room, penetrates even to the adjoining
apartments, to see if there be any person there; returns, and if the key
of the sideboard is not to be seen, he looks in all the places in which
he knows it is generally deposited, and if he finds it, he instantly
uses it to open the drawers, and taking out the plate, he places it
generally in his hat, after which, he covers it with a napkin, or fine
cambric handkerchief, which, by its texture and whiteness, announces the
gentleman. Should the <i>bonjourier</i>, whilst on his enterprise, hear
any person coming, he goes straight towards him, and accosting him,
wishes him good morning (<i>le bonjour</i>) with a smiling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>
and almost
familiar air, and inquires if it be not Monsieur 'such a one,' to whom
he has the honour of addressing himself. He is directed to the story
higher or lower, and, then still smiling, evincing the utmost politeness
and making a thousand excuses and affected bows, he withdraws. It may so
happen, that he has not had time to consummate his larceny, but most
frequently the business is perfected, and the discovery of loss only
made too late to remedy it.
</p>

<p>
"The majority of the thieves in this particular line commence their
incursions with morning, at the hour when the housekeepers go out for
their cream, or have a gossip whilst their masters and mistresses are in
bed. Other <i>bonjouriers</i> do not open the campaign until near dinner
time; they pitch upon the moment when the plate is laid upon the table.
They enter, and in the twinkling of an eye, they cause spoons, forks,
ladles, &amp;c. to vanish. This is technically termed <i>goupiner à la
desserte</i>, (clearing the cloth).
</p>

<p>
"One day one of these <i>goupineurs à la desserte</i> was on the look
out in a dining room, when a servant entered carrying two silver dishes,
between which were some fish. Without being at all disconcerted, he went
up to her, and said&mdash;'Well, go and bring up the soup, the gentlemen are
in a hurry.'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, sir,' said the maid, taking him for one of the guests, 'it is
quite ready, and if you please you can announce the dinner.'
</p>

<p>
"At the same time she ran to the kitchen, and the <i>goupineur</i>,
after having hastily emptied the dishes, thrust them between his
waistcoat and shirt. The girl returned with the broth, the pretended
guest had retired, and there was not a single piece of silver left on
the table. They denounced this theft to me, and from the statement
given, as well as the description of the person committing the robbery,
I thought I had recognised my man. He was called <i>Cheinaux</i>, alias
<i>Bayer</i>, and was discovered and apprehended in Saint Catherine's
market. His shirt was marked with the circumference of the dishes, in
consequence of the remains of the sauce left in them.
</p>

<p>
"Another body of <i>bonjouriers</i> more particularly direct their
talents to furnished houses.
</p>

<p>
"The individuals forming this class are on foot from the dawn of day.
Their talent is evinced by the adroit mode in which they baffle the
vigilance of the porters. They go up the staircase, sometimes on one
pretext, and sometimes on another, look round them, and if they find any
keys in the doors, which is common enough, they turn them with the least
possible noise. Once in the room, if the occupant be asleep, farewell to
his purse, his watch, his jewels, and all that he has that is valuable.
If he awakes, the visiter has a thousand excuses ready.
</p>

<p>
"'A thousand pardons, sir, I thought this was No. 13;' or, 'Was it you,
sir, who sent for a bootmaker, tailor, hairdresser,'" &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>


<center>
<i>The Detourneurs and Detourneuses</i>.
</center>


<p>
"The robbery <i>à la detourne</i> is that which is effected whilst
making purchases at a shop. This species of plunder is practised by
individuals of both sexes; but the <i>détourneuses</i>, or <i>lady prigs</i>,
are generally esteemed more expert than the <i>detourneurs</i>, or
<i>gentlemen prigs</i>. The reason of this superiority consists entirely in
the difference of dress; women can easily conceal a very large parcel.
</p>

<p>
"In retail shops it would be an advisable plan, when there are many
customers to serve, that from time to time the shopmen should say to
each other, <i>deux sur dix</i> (two on ten), or else <i>allumez les
gonzesses</i> (twig the prigs). I will bet a thousand to one, that on
hearing these words, the thieves, who have very fine ears, will make
haste to take themselves away.
</p>

<p>
"Shopkeepers of what class soever, particularly retailers, cannot be
too much on their guard; they should never forget that in Paris there
are thousands of male and female thieves <i>à la detourne</i>, I here
only speak of robbers by profession; but there are also <i>amateurs</i>,
who, beneath the cover of a well-established reputation, make small
acquisitions slyly and unsuspectedly. They are very honest people they
say, who with little scruple indulge their propensity for a rare book,
a miniature, a cameo, a mosaic, a manuscript, a print, a medal, or
a jewel that pleases them; they are called <i>Chipeurs</i>. If the
<i>Chipeur</i> be rich, no heed is paid to him, he is too much above
such a larceny to impute it to him as a crime; if he be poor, he is
denounced to the attorney-general, and sent to the galleys, because
he robbed from necessity. It must be owned that we have strange ideas
as to honesty and dishonesty."
</p>

<p>
This is what we call <i>Shoplifting</i>. A milliner once told us that
ribands and flowers not unfrequently attach themselves to the cuffs and
sleeves of fair purchasers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
</p>

<center>
<i>Careurs</i>
</center>


<p>
Belong to the same class of thieves, and are gipsies, Italians, or Jews.
The female Careurs are very expert in robbing priests; and Vidocq
apprehended a mother and daughter for more than sixty such offences.
</p>

<p>
"The gipsies do not confine themselves to these means of appropriating
to themselves the property of another: they frequently commit murder,
and they have the less objection to commit a murder, because they have
no feeling of any kind of remorse; and they have a peculiar kind of
expiation whereby they purify themselves. For a year they wear a coarse
woollen shirt, and abstain from '<i>work</i>' (robbing). This period
elapsed, they believe themselves white as snow. In France, the majority
of the persons of this caste call themselves Catholics, and have every
external show of great devotion. They always carry about them rosaries
and a crucifix; they say their prayers night and morning, and follow
the service with much attention and precision. In Germany, they seldom
exercise any other calling than that of horse doctor, or herbalist:
some addict themselves to medicine, that is to say, profess to be in
possession of secret means of effecting cures. A vast number of them
travel in bodies, some tell fortunes, others mend glass, china, pots,
and pans; woe to the inhabitants of the country overrun by these
vagabonds. There will infallibly be a mortality amongst the cattle, for
the gipsies are very clever in killing them, without leaving any traces
which can be converted into a charge of malevolence against them. They
kill the cows by piercing them to the heart with a long and very fine
needle, so that the blood flowing inwardly, it may be supposed that the
animal died of disease. They stifle poultry with brimstone; they know
that then they will give them the dead birds; and whilst they imagine
that they have a taste for carrion, they make good cheer, and eat
delicious meat. Sometimes they want hams, and then they take a red
herring and hold it under the nose of a pig, which, allured by the
smell, would follow them to the world's end."
</p>


<center>
<i>Rouletiers</i>
</center>


<p>
Are fellows who plunder carriages of portmanteaus, imperials, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
"One day I followed a famous <i>rouletier</i> named <i>Gosnet</i>. On reaching
the Rue Saint Denis, he jumped up on a coach, put on a cloak and cotton
cap which he found lying close to his hand, and in this dress got down
again with a portmanteau under his arm. It was not later than two
o'clock in the afternoon; but to elude all suspicion, Gosnet, on
alighting, went straight to the <i>conducteur</i> (guard), and after
having spoken to him, turned down a street close at hand. I was in
waiting for him, he was apprehended and sentenced."
</p>


<center>
<i>Tireurs</i>,
</center>


<p>
Or pickpockets are as abundant as mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
"There was in Paris a thief of such incredible dexterity that he robbed
without an accomplice. He placed himself in front of a person, put his
hand behind him, and took either a watch or some other valuable. This
species of thievery is called the <i>vol à la chicane</i>.
</p>

<p>
"A fellow named Molin, alias <i>Moulin le Chapelier</i>, being under the
portico des Français, was desirous of stealing a gentleman's purse: the
sufferer, who was near the wall, thought he felt some one picking his
pocket; Molin, full of presence of mind, effected his object in an
instant, the purse was torn from the pocket, he opened it, and taking
out a coin, asked for a ticket for the play. At the same moment the
person robbed said to him&mdash;'But, sir, you have taken my purse, give it
to me.'&mdash;'The devil I have,' replied Molin with an air of affected
surprise, 'are you quite sure?' Then looking attentively at it&mdash;'By
heavens! I thought it was mine. Oh! sir, I ask your pardon.'
</p>

<p>
"At the same time he returned the purse, and all the bystanders were
persuaded that he had done it involuntarily. This is being <i>fly</i>,
or I know nothing about it.
</p>

<p>
"At the time of the great fog, Molin and a <i>pal</i> named Dorlé were
stationed at the environs of the Place des Italiens. An old gentleman
passed, and Dorlé stole his watch which he passed to Molin. The darkness
was so great that he could not discern if it were a repeater or not, and
to ascertain this, Molin pressed down the spring: the hammer instantly
struck on the bell, and by the sound the old man knew his watch, and
instantly cried out&mdash;'My watch! my watch! pray restore me my watch,
it belonged to my grandfather, and is a family piece.'
</p>

<p>
"Whilst uttering these lamentations, he endeavoured to go in the
direction whence the sound had proceeded, to get his watch as he
expected and hoped to do. He came close up to Molin, who, under cover
of the dense fog, put his hand with the watch in it close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span>
old gentleman's ear, and pushing the spring again, said, whilst the watch
was striking&mdash;'Listen then to its sounds for the last time;' and with
this cruel advice the two thieves then went away, leaving the worthy
undone elderly to bewail his loss.
</p>

<p>
"The ancient <i>voleurs à la tire</i> cite still, as amongst the
celebrated personages of their profession, two Italians, the brothers
Verdure, the eldest of whom, convicted of forming one of a band of
chauffeurs, was sentenced to death. On the day of execution, the
younger, who was at liberty, wished to see his brother as he left the
prison, and with several of his comrades took his station on the road.
When thieves go out in the evening into a crowd they generally have a
preconcerted word of alarm or summons, by which to call or distinguish
their accomplices. Young Verdure, on seeing the fatal car, uttered
his, which was <i>lorge</i>, to which the criminal, looking about him,
replied <i>lorge</i>. This singular salute given and returned, it may be
imagined that young Verdure retired. On his road he had already stolen
two watches; he saw his brother's head fall from the block, and either
before or afterwards he was determined to carry matters to their utmost.
</p>

<p>
"The crowd having dispersed he returned to the cabaret with his
comrades. 'Well, well,' said he, laying down on the table four watches
and a purse, 'I think I have not played my cards amiss. I never thought
to have made such a haul at my <i>frater's</i> death; I am only sorry
he's not here to have his share of the <i>swag</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
Ring-droppers, and <i>Emporteurs</i> ("gentlemen who lose themselves") are
next shown up: to the latter class belong the fellows who, under
pretence of inquiring their road, fall into conversation with you,
invite you to billiards, and cheat you.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> Ring-droppers are very
troublesome in Paris, especially in the <i>Champs Elyseés</i>, where
you may be teazed to buy a copper-framed eye-glass which they have
just "found."
</p>


<center>
<i>Riffaudeurs, or Chauffeurs</i>,
</center>


<p>
Were thieves assuming the garb of country dealers, or travelling
hawkers; and they sought to wring from their victims a confession of
where they had concealed their treasure, by applying fire to the soles
of their feet.
</p>

<p>
The Fourth Volume closes abruptly with a story of a gang of them, which
has all the horrors of rack and torture. In the Translator's sequel we
find the following:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Since the commencement of these Memoirs, M. Vidocq has given up his
paper manufactory at St. Mandé, and has been subsequently confined in
Sainte Pelagie for debt. His embarrassments are stated to have arisen
from a passion for gambling, a propensity which, once indulged, takes
deep root in the human mind; and few indeed, lamentably few, are those
who can effectually eradicate the fatal passion. Vidocq, who could
assume all shapes like a second Proteus, who underwent bitter hardships,
and unsparingly jeopardized his life at any time, could not resist the
fell temptation which has brought him to distress and a prison.
</p>

<p>
"It has been stated in some of the Journals that Vidocq has a son
named Julius, who was condemned to the galleys, and when liberated was
employed by his father at Sainte Mandé. This must be another bitter
in his life's cup, which Vidocq seems condemned to drain to the very
dregs."
</p>

<p>
We need hardly be told why Vidocq has withheld the information
respecting the state of crime in France, which he promised, and made a
grand parade of possessing. The length to which his Memoirs have been
spun out is tedious, and the air of romance which he has given to some
scenes in the concluding volume, almost invalidates its forerunners.
Still we are bound to confess that his adventures are equal in interest
to any work of fact or fiction that has appeared for several years.
We omit the translations of some slang songs, one of which appeared
recently in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>; still, they are exceedingly
clever in their way.
</p>

<p>
The present volume has a portrait of Vidocq, upon which we hope the
physiognomists will speculate; for with all his peccadilloes, (and a
hard set of features which the engraver has probably hardened) the
author must be a clever and a very pleasant fellow; and we wish some
myrmidon of our police&mdash;some English Vidocq&mdash;would write four pretty
pocket volumes like those of the French policeman. Perhaps some of the
new appointed will take this hint.
</p>

<p>
To conclude, after what we have said, our readers need not be
recommended to turn to <i>Vidocq's Memoirs</i>. They will find the
translation generally well executed, although we have detected several
slips in the last volume.

<h2>
	SOUTHWELL CHURCH.
</h2>

<a href="images/389-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/389-2.png"

<b>SOUTHWELL CHURCH</b>
</div>



<p>
The town of Southwell, in the county of Nottingham, is situated in the
midst of an amphitheatre of well-wooded hills; the soil is rich, and the
air, from the vicinity of the River Trent, is remarkably pure. It is
fourteen miles north-east of Nottingham, about as many south-east of
Mansfield, and eight south-west from Newark; the River Greet, famous
for red trout, runs by the side of the town, falling into the Trent,
at about three miles distance.
</p>

<p>
The most ancient part of the church is of the order usually called
Saxon, and from tradition is said to have been built in the time of
Harold, predecessor of William I. But there is no history or written
instrument of any kind now extant, concerning the origin of this
structure. The two side aisles are of pure Norman architecture.
The choir was built in the reign of Edward III. as appears by a license
of the eleventh year of that king's reign, to the chapter, to get
stones from a quarry in Shirewood Forest for building the choir. The
chapter-house is a detached building, connected by a cloister with
the north aisle of the choir, and is on the model of that at York.
The arch of entrance from the aisle, is said to exceed in elegance and
correctness of execution, almost every thing of the kind in the kingdom;
the chapter-house is of Gothic architecture, and the arch forming the
approach is considered of modern insertion, the sculpture being finer
and more delicate than any thing near it. This church and Ripon are
said to be the only parochial, as well as collegiate, churches now in
England, the rest having been dissolved by Henry VIII. or his
successors.
</p>

<p>
At the Reformation, its chantries were dissolved, and the order of
priests expelled about the year 1536. In 1542, Lee, then Archbishop
of York, granted, by indenture to the king, the manor of Southwell.
In the thirty-fourth year of his reign, Henry VIII., by act of
parliament, declared Southwell the head and mother church of the town
and county of Nottingham, and soon afterwards re-founded and re-endowed
it, probably at the instance of Cranmer, at that time in the height of
favour, who was a native of Nottinghamshire, not far from Southwell.
Soon after the accession of Edward VI. the chapter was again dissolved,
and its prebendal, and other estates granted to John, Earl of Warwick,
afterwards made Duke of Northumberland; by him they were sold to John
Beaumont, Master of the Rolls, and coming soon afterwards to the crown,
by escheat, were granted to the favourite Northumberland, who retained
them until his attainder in 1553, when they again reverted to the crown;
and by Queen Mary were restored to the Archbishop of York, in as ample
manner as they had before been holden. It appears from the <i>Registrum
Album</i>, a register of the church, that in the latter end of the
reign of William I. there were at least ten prebends. In the office of
augmentation, an estimate of Southwell College, in the first of Edward
VI. states King Edgar to have been the founder of the church, which
consisted of sixteen prebends, and sixteen vicars. There are now sixteen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span>
prebends, of which the Archbishop of York is sole patron, a
vicar-general appointed out of the prebendaries by the chapter, six
vicars, and six choristers. Alfric, appointed to the See of York in
1023, gave two large bells to the church of Southwell (William of
Malmsbury.) This was about the time of bells coming generally into use.
King Stephen granted that the canons of Southwell should hold the woods
of their prebends, in their own hands, which succeeding monarchs, Henry
II. Richard, John, and Henry III. confirmed. There are two fellowships,
and two scholarships, founded in St. John's College, Cambridge, by Dr.
Keton, canon of Sarum, twenty-second Henry VI. to be presented by the
master, fellows, and scholars of that college, to persons having served
as choristers in the chapter of Southwell. In the civil wars nearly all
the records of Southwell Church were destroyed, the <i>Registrum
Album</i> escaping, which contains grants of most of the revenues
belonging to the church, from soon after the conquest, nearly to the end
of Henry VIII. Southwell is supposed by antiquarians to be the "<i>Ad
Pontem</i>" of the Romans, one of the stations on the Roman Way from
London to Lincoln, situated at a distance from any route of importance
between the most frequented part of the kingdom. For many centuries it
was hardly known by name&mdash;and, till within thirty years there was no
turnpike road to it in any direction. Thus denied access to the rest
of the world, the people of Southwell lived a separate and distinct
society, retaining their own manners untainted by the world; and
among them traditions were handed down pure and unadulterated by the
speculations of the learned, or the discoveries of antiquarians.

<h2>
	THE SKETCH-BOOK.
</h2>



<hr />


<h3>
	SIGHMON DUMPS.
</h3>


<p>
Anthony Dumps, the father of my hero (the subject matter of a story
being always called the hero, however little heroic he may personally
have been) married Dora Coffin on St. Swithin's day in the first year
of the last reign.
</p>

<p>
Anthony was then comfortably off, but through a combination of adverse
circumstances he went rapidly down in the world, became a bankrupt, and
being obliged to vacate his residence in St. Paul's Churchyard, he
removed to No. 3, Burying Ground Buildings, Paddington Road, where Mrs.
Dumps was delivered of a son.
</p>

<p>
The depressed pair agreed to christen their babe Simon, but the
name was registered in the parish book with the first syllable spelt
"S&mdash;I&mdash;G&mdash;H;"&mdash;whether the trembling hand of the afflicted parent
orthographically erred, or whether a bungling clerk caused the error
I know not; but certain it is that the infant Dumps was registered
SIGHMON.
</p>

<p>
Sighmon sighed away his infancy like other babes and sucklings, and when
he grew to be a hobedy-hoy, there was a seriousness in his visage, and
a much-ado-about-nothing-ness in his eye, which were proclaimed by good
natured people to be indications of deep thought and profundity; while
others less "flattering sweet," declared they indicated naught but want
of comprehension, and the dulness of stupidity.
</p>

<p>
As he grew older he grew graver, sad was his look, sombre the tone of
his voice, and half an hour's conversation with him was a very serious
affair indeed.
</p>

<p>
Burying Ground Buildings, Paddington Road, was the scene of his infant
sports. Since his failure, his father had earned his <i>lively</i>hood,
by letting himself out as a mute, or mourner, to a furnisher of
funerals.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mute</i>" and "<i>voluntary woe</i>" were his stock in trade.
</p>

<p>
Often did Mrs. Dumps ink the seams of his small-clothes, and darken his
elbows with a blacking brush, ere he sallied forth to follow borrowed
plumes; and when he returned from his public performance (<i>oft
rehearsed</i>) Master Sighmon did innocently crumple his crapes, and
sport with his weepers.
</p>

<p>
His melancholy outgoings at length were rewarded by some pecuniary
incomings. The demise of others secured a living for him, and after a
few unusually propitious sickly seasons, he grimly smiled as he counted
his gains: the mourner exulted, and, in praise of his profession, the
mute became eloquent.
</p>

<p>
Another event occurred: after burying so many people professionally, he
at length buried Mrs. Dumps; <i>that</i>, of course, was by no means a
matter of business. I have before remarked that she was descended from
the Coffins; she was now gathered to her ancestors.
</p>

<p>
Dumps had long been proud of gentility of appearance, a suit of black
had been his working day costume, nothing therefore could be more easy
than for Dumps to turn gentleman. He did so; took a villa at Gravesend,
chose for his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>
own sitting room a chamber that looked against a dead
wall, and whilst he was lying in state upon the squabs of his sofa, he
thought seriously of the education of his son, and resolved that he
should be instantly taught the dead languages.
</p>

<p>
Sighmon Dumps was decidedly a young man of a serious turn of mind.
The metropolis had few attractions for him, he loved to linger near
the monument; and if ever he thought of a continental excursion, the
Catacombs and Père la Chaise were his seducers.
</p>

<p>
His father died, his old employer furnished him with a funeral; the mute
was silenced, and the mourner was mourned.
</p>

<p>
Sighmon Dumps became more serious than ever; he had a decided nervous
malady, an abhorrence of society, and a sensitive shrinking when he felt
that any body was looking at him. He had heard of the invisible girl; he
would have given worlds to have been an invisible young gentleman, and
to have glided in and out of rooms, unheeded and unseen, like a draft
through a keyhole. This, however, was not to be his lot; like a man
cursed with creaking shoes, stepping lightly, and tiptoeing availed not;
a <i>creak</i> always betrayed him when he was most anxious to creep
into a corner.
</p>

<p>
At his father's death he found himself possessed of a competency and a
villa; but he was unhappy, he was known in the neighbourhood, people
called on him, and he was expected to call on them, and these calls and
recalls bored him. He never, in his life, could abide looking any one
straight in the face; a pair of human eyes meeting his own was actually
painful to him. It was not to be endured. He sold his villa, and
determined to go to some place where, being a total stranger, he might
pass unnoticed and unknown, attracting no attention, no remarks.
</p>

<p>
He went to Cheltenham and consulted Boisragon about his nerves, was
recommended a course of the waters, and horse exercise.
</p>

<p>
The son of the weeper very naturally thought he had already "too much
of water;" he, however, hired a nag, took a small suburban lodging, and
as nobody spoke to him, nor seemed to care about him, he grew better,
and felt sedately happy. This blest seclusion, "the world forgetting,
by the world forgot," was not the predestined fate of Sighmon: odd
circumstances always brought him into notice. The horse he had hired was
a piebald, a sweet, quiet animal, warranted a safe support for a timid
invalid. On this piebald did Dumps jog through the green lanes in brown
studies.
</p>

<p>
One day as he passed a cottage, a face peered at him through an open
window; he heard an exclamation of delight, the door opened, and an
elderly female ran after him, entreating him to stop; much against the
grain he complied.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas heaven sent you, sir," said his pursuer, out of breath; "give me
for the love of mercy the cure for the rhumatiz."
</p>

<p>
"The what?" said Dumps.
</p>

<p>
"The rhumatiz, sir; I've the pains and the aches in my back and my
bones&mdash;give me the dose that will cure me."
</p>

<p>
In vain Dumps declared his ignorance of the virtues of "medicinal gums."
The more he protested, the more the old woman sued; when to his horror a
reinforcement joined her from the cottage, and men, women, and children
implored him to cure the good dame's malady. At length watching a
favourable opportunity, he insinuated his heel into the side of the
piebald, and trotted off, while entreaties mingled with words of anger
were borne to him on the wind.
</p>

<p>
He determined to avoid that green lane in future, and rode out the next
day in an opposite direction: as he trotted through a village a girl ran
after him, shouting for a cure for the hooping cough, a dame with a low
curtsey solicited a remedy for the colic, and an old man asked him what
was good for the palsy. These unforeseen, these unaccountable attacks
were fearful annoyances to so retiring a personage as Dumps. Day after
day, go where he would, the same things happened. He was solicited to
cure "all the ills that flesh is heir to." He was not aware (any more
than the reader very possibly may be) that in some parts of England the
country people have an idea that a quack doctor rides a piebald horse;
<i>why</i>, I cannot explain, but so it is, and that poor Dumps felt to
his cost. Life became a burthen to him; he was a marked man; <i>he</i>,
whose only wish was to pass unnoticed, unheard, unseen; <i>he</i>, who
of all the creeping things on the earth, pitied the glowworm most,
because the spark in its tail attracted observation. He gave up his
lodgings and his piebald, and went "in his angry mood to Tewksbury."
</p>

<p>
I ought ere this to have described my hero. He was rather <i>embonpoint</i>,
but fat was not with him, as it sometimes is, twin brother to fun;
<i>his</i> fat was weighty,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span>
he was inclined to <i>blubber</i>. He wore a wig, and
carried in his countenance an expression indicative of the seriousness
of his turn of mind.
</p>

<p>
He alighted from the coach at the principal inn at Tewksbury; the
landlady met him in the hall, started, smiled, and escorted him into a
room with much civility. He took her aside, and briefly explained that
retirement, quiet, and a back room to himself were the accommodations
he sought.
</p>

<p>
"I understand you sir," replied the landlady, with a knowing wink,
"a little quiet will be agreeable by way of change; I hope you'll find
every thing here to your liking." She then curtseyed and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
"Frank," said the hostess to the head waiter, "who <i>do</i> you think
we've got in the blue parlour? you'll never guess! I knew him the minute
I clapped eyes on him; dressed just as I saw him at the Haymarket
Theatre, the only night I ever was at a London stage play. The gray
coat, and the striped trousers, and the hessian boots over them, and the
straw hat out of all shape, and the gingham umbrella!"
</p>

<p>
"Who is he, ma'am?" said Frank. "Why, the great comedy actor, Mr.
Liston," replied the landlady, "come down for a holiday; he wants to be
quiet, so we must not blab, or the whole town will be after him."
</p>

<p>
This brief dialogue will account for much disquietude which subsequently
befell our ill fated Dumps. People met him, he could not imagine why,
with a broad grin on their features. As they passed they whispered to
each other, and the words "inimitable," "clever creature," "irresistibly
comic," evidently applied to himself, reached his ears.
</p>

<p>
Dumps looked more serious than ever; but the greater his gravity, the
more the people smiled, and one young lady actually laughed in his face
as she said aloud, "Oh, that mock heroic tragedy look is <i>so</i> like
him!"
</p>

<p>
Sighmon sighed for the seclusion of number three, Burying Ground
Buildings, Paddington Road.
</p>

<p>
One morning his landlady announced, with broader grin than usual, that a
gentleman desired to speak with him; he grumbled, but submitted, and the
gentleman was announced.
</p>

<p>
"My name, sir, is Opie," said the stranger; "I am quite delighted to see
you here. You intend gratifying the good people of Tewksbury of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Gratifying! what <i>can</i> you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"If your name is announced, there'll not be a box to be had."
</p>

<p>
"I always look after my own boxes, I can tell you," replied Dumps.
</p>

<p>
"By all means, you <i>will</i> come out here of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Come out? to be sure, I sha'n't stay within doors always."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean to come out in?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what I've got on will do very well."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's so like you," said Opie, shaking his sides with laughter,
"you really <i>are</i> inimitable!&mdash;What character do you select here?"
</p>

<p>
"Character!" said Dumps, "the stranger."
</p>

<p>
"The Stranger! <i>you?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>I.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"And you really mean to come out here as the Stranger?" said Opie.
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes to be sure&mdash;I'm but just come."
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall put your name in large letters immediately, we will open
this evening; and as to terms, you shall have half the receipts of the
house."
</p>

<p>
Off ran Mr. Opie, who was no less a personage than the manager of the
theatre, leaving Dumps fully persuaded that he had been closeted with
a lunatic.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards he saw a man very busy pasting bills against a wall
opposite his window, and so large were the letters that he easily
deciphered, "THE CELEBRATED MR. LISTON IN TRAGEDY. This evening THE
STRANGER, the Part of THE STRANGER BY MR. LISTON." Dumps had never seen
the inimitable Liston, indeed comedy was quite out of his way. But now
that the star was to shine forth in tragedy, the announcement was
congenial to the serious turn of his mind, and he resolved to go.
</p>

<p>
He ate an early dinner, went by times to the theatre, and established
himself in a snug corner of the stage box. The house filled, the hour
of commencement arrived, the fiddlers paused and looked towards the
curtain, but hearing no signal they fiddled another strain. The audience
became impatient; they hissed, they hooted, and they called for the
manager: another pause, another yell of disapprobation, and the manager
pale and trembling appeared, and walked hat in hand to the front of the
stage. To Dumps's great surprise it was the very man who visited him in
the morning. Mr. Opie cleared his throat, bowed repeatedly, moved his
lips, but was inaudible amid the shouts of "hear him." At length silence
was obtained, and he spoke as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span>
</p>

<p>
"I appear before you to entreat your kind and considerate forbearance;
I lament as much, nay more than you, the absence of Mr. Liston; but, in
the anguish of the moment, one thought supports me, the consciousness
of having done my duty. (<i>Applause</i>.) I had an interview with
your deservedly favourite performer this morning, and every necessary
arrangement was made between us. I have sent to his hotel, and he is not
to be found. (<i>Disapprobation</i>.) I have been informed that he dined
early, and left the house, saying that he was going to the theatre; what
accident <i>can</i> have prevented his arrival I am utterly unable to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Opie now happened to glance towards the stage box, surprise! doubt!
anger! certainty! were the alternate expressions of his pale face, and
widely opened eyes; and at length pointing to Dumps he exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my painful duty to inform you that Mr.
Liston is now before you; there he sits at the back of the stage box,
and I trust I may be permitted to call upon him for an explanation of
his very singular conduct."
</p>

<p>
Every eye turned towards Dumps, every voice was uplifted against him;
the man who could not endure the scrutiny of <i>one</i> pair of eyes,
now beheld a house full of them glaring at him with angry indignation.
His head became confused, he had a slight consciousness of being elbowed
through the lobby, of a riot in the crowded street, and of being
protected by the civil authorities against the uncivil attacks of the
populace. He was conveyed to bed, and awoke the next morning with a very
considerable accession of nervous malady.
</p>

<p>
He soon heard that the whole town vowed vengeance against the infamous
and unprincipled impostor who had so impudently played off a practical
joke on the public, and at dead of night did he escape from the town of
Tewksbury, in a return mourning coach, with which he was accommodated
by his tender hearted landlady.
</p>

<p>
Our persecuted hero next occupied private apartments at a boarding-house
at Malvern. Privacy was refreshing, but, alas! its duration was doomed
to be short. A young officer who had witnessed the embarrassment of "the
stranger" at Tewksbury, recognised the sufferer at Malvern, and knowing
his nervous antipathy to being noticed, he wickedly resolved to make him
the lion of the place.
</p>

<p>
He dined at the public table, spoke of the gentleman who occupied the
private apartments, wondered that no one appeared to be aware who he
was, and then <i>in confidence</i> informed the assembled party that
the recluse was the celebrated author of the "Pleasures of Memory," now
engaged in illustrating "HIS ITALY" with splendid embellishments from
the pencils of Stothard and Turner.
</p>

<p>
Dumps again found himself an object of universal curiosity, every body
became officiously attentive to him, he was waylaid in his walks, and
<i>intentionally</i> intruded upon <i>by accident</i> in his private apartments;
a travelling artist requested to be permitted to take his portrait for
the exhibition, a lady requested him to peruse her manuscript romance
and to give his unbiassed opinion, and the master of the boarding-house
waited upon him by desire of his guests to request that he would honour
the public table with his company. Several ladies solicited his
autograph for their albums, and several gentlemen called a meeting
of the inhabitants, and resolved to give him a public dinner; a
craniologist requested to be permitted to take a cast of his head,
and as a climax to his misery, when he was sitting in his bedchamber
thinking himself at least secure for the present, the door being bolted;
he looked towards the Malvern Hills, which rise abruptly immediately
at the back of the boarding-house, and there he discovered a party of
ladies eagerly gazing at him with long telescopes through the open
windows!
</p>

<p>
He left Malvern the next morning, and went to a secluded village on the
Welsh coast, not far from Swansea.
</p>

<p>
The events of the last few weeks had rendered poor Sighmon Dumps more
sensitively nervous than ever. His seclusion became perpetual, his blind
always down, and he took his solitary walks in the dusk of the evening.
He had been told that sea sickness was sometimes beneficial in cases
resembling his own; he, therefore, bargained with some boatmen, who
engaged to take him out into the channel, on a little experimental
medicinal trip. At a very early hour in the morning he went down to the
beach, and prepared to embark. He had observed two persons who appeared
to be watching him, he felt certain they were dogging him, and just as
he was stepping into the boat they seized him, saying, "Sir, we know you
to be the great defaulter who has been so long concealed on this coast;
we know you are trying to escape to America, but you must come with us."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
</p>

<p>
Sighmon's heart was broken. He felt it would be useless to endeavour to
explain or to expostulate; he spoke not, but was passively hurried to a
carriage in which he was borne to the metropolis as fast as four horses
could carry him, without rest or refreshment. Of course, after a minute
examination, he was declared innocent, and was released; but justice
smiled too late, the bloom of Sighmon's happiness had been prematurely
nipped.
</p>

<p>
He called in the aid of the first medical advice, grew a little better;
and when the doctor left him he prescribed a medicine which he said he
had no doubt would restore the patient to health. The medicine came,
the bottle was shaken, the contents taken&mdash;Sighmon died!
</p>

<p>
It was afterwards discovered that a mistake had occasioned his premature
departure; a healing liquid had been prescribed for him, but the
careless dispenser of the medicine had dispensed with caution on the
occasion, and Dumps died of a severe <i>oxalic</i> acidity of the
stomach! By his own desire he was interred in the churchyard opposite to
Burying Ground Buildings, Paddington Road. His funeral was conducted
with <i>almost</i> as much decorum as if his late father the mute had
been present, and he was left with&mdash;

But even there he could not rest! The next morning it was discovered
that the body of Sighmon Dumps had been stolen by resurrection
men!&mdash;<i>Sharpe's Mag.</i>

<h3>
	BEWICK, THE ENGRAVER.
</h3>

<center>
<i>By a Correspondent of the Magazine of Natural History.</i>
</center>


<p>
Bewick's first tendency to drawing was noticed by his chalking the
floors and grave-stones with all manner of fantastic figures, and by
sketching the outline of any known character of the village, dogs, or
horses, which were instantly recognised as faithful portraits. The
halfpence he got were always laid out in chalk or coarse pencils; with
which, when taken to church, he scrawled over the ledges of the bench
ludicrous caricatures of the parson, clerk, and the more prominent of
the congregation. These boards are now in the possession of the Duke
of Northumberland, by whom they were replaced; and when his chalk
was exhausted, he resorted to a pin or a nail as a substitute. In
consequence of this propensity to drawing, some liberal people, of whom
he says, there were many in Newcastle, got him bound apprentice to a Mr.
Bielby, an engraver on copper and brass. During this period he walked
most Sundays to Ovingham (ten miles,) to see his parents; and, if the
Tyne was low, crossed it on stilts; but, if high-flowing, hollaed across
to inquire their health, and returned. This infant genius (but it was
the infant Hercules struggling with the snakes) was bound down by his
master to cut clock-faces and door-knockers&mdash;ay, clock-faces and
door-knockers!&mdash;and he actually showed me several in the streets of
Newcastle he had cut. At this time he was employed by Bielby to cut
on wood the blocks for Dr. Hutton's great work on <i>Mensuration</i>.
Hutton was then a schoolmaster at Newcastle (1770.)
</p>

<p>
After his apprenticeship, he worked a short time for a person in Hatton
Garden; but he disliked London extremely, still panting for his native
home, to whose braes and bonny banks he joyously returned; where he was
occupied in cutting figures and ornaments for books; and now received
his first prize from the Society of Arts for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>
the "Old Hound," in an
edition of Gay's <i>Fables</i>. A glance at this cut will show what a
low state wood-engraving was at, when a public society deemed it worthy
a reward; yet even in this are readily visible some lines and touches of
the future great master of this delicious art. He never omitted visiting
itinerant caravans of animals, from whose living looks and attitudes he
made spirited drawings. This led to his <i>History of Quadrupeds</i>,
1790; the first block, however, of which, he cut the very day of his
father's death, Nov. 15, 1785. From this work he obtained very
considerable celebrity; which led him shortly to draw and engrave the
wild bull at Chillingham, Lord Tankerville's, the largest of all his
wood-cuts, impressions of which have actually been sold at twenty
guineas each; and also the zebra, elephant, lion, and tiger, for Pidcock
(Exeter 'Change,) copies whereof are now extremely scarce and valuable.
He also executed some curious works on copper, to illustrate a <i>Tour
through Lapland</i>, by Matthew Consett, Esq.; and his <i>Quadrupeds</i>
having passed through seven editions, his fame was widely and well
established. The famous typographer, Bulmer, of the Shakspeare Press
(a native of Newcastle,) now employed John Bewick, who, at the age of
fourteen, had also been aprenticed to Bielby, in co-operation with
his brother Thomas, to embellish a splendid edition of Goldsmith's
<i>Deserted Village</i> and <i>Hermit</i>, Parnell's <i>Poems</i>, and Somerville's
<i>Chase</i>. The designs and execution of these were so admirable and
ingenious, that the late king, George III. doubted their being worked
on wood, and requested a sight of the blocks, at which he was equally
delighted and astonished. It is deeply to be lamented we have so few
specimens of the talents of John Bewick, who died of a pulmonary
complaint, 1795, at the early age of thirty-five.
</p>

<p>
I now, in this hasty, feeble, and divaricated biographical sketch,
approach the great and favourite work of my admired friend, <i>The
History of British Birds</i>. The first volume of this all-delighting
work was published in 1797, jointly by Bielby and Bewick, but was
afterwards continued by Bewick. This beautiful, accurate, animated,
and (I may really add) wonderful production, having passed through six
editions, each of very numerous impressions, is now universally known
and admired.
</p>

<p>
The first time I had <i>personal</i> interview with my venerable friend
was at Newcastle upon Tyne, on Wednesday, October 1, 1823, after
perambulating the romantic regions of Cumberland and Westmoreland, with
my friend, John E. Bowman, Esq., F.L.S. We had been told that he retired
from his workbench on evenings to the "Blue Bell on the side," for the
purpose of reading the news. To this place we repaired, and readily
found ourselves in the presence of the great man. For my part, so warm
was my enthusiasm, that I could have rushed into his arms, as into
those of a parent or benefactor. He was sitting by the fire in a large
elbow-chair, smoking. He received us most kindly, and in a very few
minutes we felt as old friends. He appeared a large, athletic man, then
in his seventy-first year, with thick, bushy, black hair, retaining his
sight so completely as to read aloud rapidly the smallest type of a
newspaper. He was dressed in very plain, brown clothes, but of good
quality, with large flaps to his waistcoat, grey woollen stockings,
and large buckles. In his under-lip he had a prodigious large quid of
tobacco, and he leaned on a very thick oaken cudgel, which, I afterwards
learned, he cut in the woods of Hawthornden. His broad, bright, and
benevolent countenance at one glance, bespoke powerful intellect and
unbounded good-will, with a very visible sparkle of merry wit. The
discourse at first turned on politics (for the paper was in his hand,)
on which he at once openly avowed himself a warm whig, but clearly
without the slightest wish to provoke opposition. I at length succeeded
in turning the conversation into the fields of natural history, but
not till after he had scattered forth a profusion of the most humorous
anecdotes, that would baffle the most retentive memory to enumerate,
and defy the most witty to depict. I succeeded by mentioning an error
in one of his works; for which, when I had convinced him, he thanked
me, and took the path in conversation we wished. In many instances,
I must remark, though frequently succeeding to the broadest humour, his
countenance and conversation assumed the emitted flashes and features
of absolutely the highest sublimity; indeed, to an excitement of awful
amazement, particularly when speaking on the works of the Deity.

<h3>
	DURATION OF LIFE.
</h3>

<p>
It appears from well authenticated documents, that the mean term of Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>
life, among the citizens, was 30 years&mdash;that is to say, taking 1,000
persons, adding the years together they each attained, and dividing the
total by the number of persons, the result is 30. In England, at the
present time, the expectation of life, for persons similarly situated,
is at least 50 years, giving a superiority of 20 years above the Roman
citizen. The mean term of life among the <i>easy</i> classes at Paris is
at present 42. At Florence, to the <i>whole</i> population, it is still
not more than 30.
</p>

<p>
We have gleaned these interesting facts from a review of Dr. Hawkins's
<i>Elements of Medical Statistics;</i> and as the subject is like human
life itself, of exhaustless interest, we shall proceed with a few more:
</p>


<center>
<i>Counties of England and Wales.</i>
</center>

<p>
In 1780, the annual mortality of England and Wales was 1 in 40.
By the last census (of 1821,) the yearly mortality had fallen to
1 in 58, nearly one-third. The rate of mortality is of course not
equal throughout the country. According to Dr. Hawkins, this is mainly
influenced by the proportion of large towns which any district or county
contains. The lowest well-ascertained rate of mortality in any part of
Europe is that of Pembrokeshire and Anglesey, in Wales, where only one
death takes place annually out of eighty-three individuals. Sussex
enjoys the lowest rate of mortality of any English county; it is there
1 in 72. Middlesex, on the other hand, affords the other extreme,
1 in 47; yet here, where the rate of mortality is higher than in any
part of England, great improvements in the mean duration of life are
taking place; for in 1811, the mortality was as great as 1 in 36. Kent,
Surrey, Lancashire, Warwickshire, and Cheshire, are the counties where,
next to Middlesex, the deaths are most numerous. The three last named
counties enjoy many natural advantages, but these are more than
counterbalanced by the number and density of their manufacturing towns.
It is a circumstance well worthy of note, that the aguish counties of
England do not, as might have been expected, stand high in the list.
In Lincolnshire, the rate of mortality is only 1 in 62. Dr. Hawkins
hesitates whether to attribute this to the large proportion of dry and
elevated district which that county possesses, or to the exemption of
fenny countries generally from consumption. We are strongly inclined to
suspect that the latter is the true explanation of the fact. The notion
was originally thrown out by the late ingenious physician, Dr. Wells,
who even went so far as to advise the removal of consumptive patients
to the heart of the Cambridgeshire fens, rather than to Hastings or
Sidmouth.
</p>

<p>
The author goes on to remark, "that the decline in the mortality is
even more striking in our cities than in our rural districts. While the
metropolis has extended itself in all directions, and multiplied its
inhabitants to an enormous amount,&mdash;in other words, while the seeming
sources of its unhealthiness have been largely augmented, it has
actually become more friendly to health." In the middle of the last
century, the annual mortality was about 1 in 20. By the census of 1821,
it appeared as 1 in 40: so that in the space of seventy years, the
chances of existence are exactly <i>doubled</i> in London,&mdash;a progress
and final result, adds the author, without a parallel in the history of
any other age or country. The high rate of mortality in London about the
year 1750, exceeding considerably that of former years, has been
attributed to the great, abuse of spirituous liquors, which were then
sold without the very necessary check of high duties. One of the results
of these statistical investigations which, <i>a priori</i>, we should
least have been prepared for, is the uncommon healthiness of Manchester.
The rate of mortality there at the present time does not appear to
exceed 1 in 74.
</p>

<p>
The statistics of the sexes afford some curious results. The relative
numbers of the sexes are the same in all parts of the world,&mdash;namely,
at birth, twenty-one males to twenty females, but as the mortality
among males during infancy exceeds that of females, the sexes at the
age of fifteen are nearly equal. A late French writer, M. Giron, thinks
himself warranted in the opinion, that agricultural pursuits favour an
increase in the male, while commerce and manufactures encourage the
female population. There exists throughout the world considerable
variety in the proportion of births to marriages, but, upon an average,
we may state it at about four to one. It has been uniformly found,
however, that improvements in the public health are attended by a
<i>diminution</i> of marriages and births. The great principle is this:
as the number of men cannot exceed their means of subsistence, <i>if men
live longer, a less number is born</i>, and the human race is maintained
at its due complement with fewer deaths and fewer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>
births, a contingency favourable in every respect to happiness. The
author illustrates this very important principle by the population
returns both of England and France.

<p>
Major R&mdash;&mdash; was not long since riding near a building which presented
to his admiring gaze a fine specimen of antique Saxon architecture.
Desirous to learn something respecting it, he made some inquiries of
a man, who as it happened was the <i>souter</i> of the village. This
learned wight informed the inquisitive stranger that the building in
question was reckoned a noble specimen of <i>Gothic</i> architecture,
and was built by the <i>Romans</i>, who came over with Julius Caesar.
"Friend," said the Major, "you make anachronisms." "No, no, Sir,"
replied the man, "indeed I don't make <i>anachronisms</i>, for I never
made any thing but <i>shoes</i> in my life."

The same gentleman, one day fitting on a new under-waistcoat, which he
had ordered to be made of a material that should resist rain and damp,
said to the tailor in attendance, "But are you sure that it is

astonishment, "I certainly can't pretend to say that it is

By love's delightful influence the attack of ill-humour is resisted; the

all the injuries of the world alleviated; and the sweetest flowers
plentifully strewed along the path of life.

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
